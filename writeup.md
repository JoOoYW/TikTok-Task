Our research explored how comments on a vegan creator’s TikTok video reflected broader perceptions of vegan and vegetarian diets. Using 1,000 comments, we aimed to sort reactions into two major categories: those that support plant-based eating and those that oppose it. Achieving reliable coding turned out to be the hardest part. Early on, our concepts were very vague (“for” vs. “against” veganism), which led to confusion, especially around edge-case topics like seafood. Once we rewrote the prompt specifying and incorporating indicators (explicit praise, adopting the diet, mocking, appeals to taste, etc.), both the AI and us aligned far better. This clarity boosted Krippendorff’s Alpha to 0.750 for Concept 1 and 0.702 for Concept 2, showing substantial improvement in inter-rater reliability for Concept 1 and some imporvement for Concept 2.

As a side note, it was inrecibly difficult to raise Concept 2's inter-rater reliability. It wasn't until after about 20 different rewritings and a new coding between us that we manager to raise it just enough. This might mean that our definition of "anti-vegan" is incredibly broad and vague versus what the LLM thinks. The tone of a comment is also something we as the human coders picked up but could have been passed over too, placing the comment in neither when it should have been for Concept 2.

The results reveal an interesting dynamic in how different viewpoints surface on social platforms. Comments supportive of veganism gathered more likes overall, which makes sense given the vegan creator’s audience. Yet opposing comments showed up more frequently in the “top” comment section. Our interpretation is that supportive comments may get buried in reply chains, while critical comments posted by outsiders stand alone and are therefore more visible. This also explains why opposing comments received the most replies: they tended to spark arguments and outrage from the creator’s supporters, driving up engagement.

Overall, the analysis shows that comment sections around vegan content are not simply divided into supporters and critics. Clearer concept definitions were essential for us (and the LLM) to code this complexity accurately, underscoring how important precise instructions are when analyzing messy, emotionally charged online discourse.
