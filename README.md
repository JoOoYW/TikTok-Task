Project: Comment Analysis on Vegan/Vegetarian TikTok Content

This project explores how people respond to vegan and vegetarian content on social media. We collected comments from a TikTok video posted by a vegan creator and analyzed patterns in support and opposition toward plant-based diets. Our goal was to understand how viewers express their reactions and how these reactions show up in visibility metrics such as likes and replies.

We used an LLM to assist with coding and refined our instructions multiple times to improve consistency between human and AI labeling. The final dataset includes classifications for each comment, reliability scores, and visualizations that summarize how support and criticism appear across the platform.

The included files contain our cleaned data, reliability results, graphs, and a written summary of findings.
