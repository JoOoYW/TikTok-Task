## Video 
We chose [https://www.tiktok.com/@livekindly/video/7499929149612559647](https://www.tiktok.com/@livekindly/video/7499929149612559647), a short form video about the reasons why someone had switched to veganism. While many vegetarians and vegans have correct reasons to opt out of meat, many times there means to convince others is through guilt and manipulation. livekindly here chose to show farm animals, many of which would be considered cute in our eyes. It's always interesting to see the reaction from others too, especially when fish are shown as an exception. 

## Research Question 
How do comments on videos posted by vegan/vegetarian creators reflect perceptions of a vegan/vegetarian diet, measured by an analysis of 1000 comments?

## Concepts
The first two concepts we chose were obvious but a little lacking in description, suppport or oppose veganism. However, after looking through the comments, the concepts became a lot more vague which made it harder to code. Especially when someone brought up seafood, it's hard to say if they supported veganism but were simply confused when the creator ate sushi. 

The next concepts were a little more specified, supports removing meat from their diet or against and criticizing veganism. This time, we decided any comment mentioning fish was a small criticism against vegans and their hypocrisy of eating life with clear sentience. There were also a few comments that talked about adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet but had their reservations. They clearly didn't oppose it necessarily, but also didn't support it as they were hesitant. However, with the second set of concepts, thinking about removing meat from their diet is enough to support it.
